# Practice building complicated forms

The goal is to mainly practice handling complicated states on a form with React with TypeScript.

I'm using and learning the following things as well:

- [React's useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) to handle the state ðŸ§¶

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to add interfacing, type checking, and prevent errors ðŸ›¡

- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for handling forms ðŸ‘Œ

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to quickly spin up good styles âš¡

Run `yarn build:tailwind` first to generate tailwind's CSS
